## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Gemini API (for captcha solving)
1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

### 3. Test the Setup
```bash
npm run test:gemini
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Team Management

The platform now supports multi-tenant team management:

### How It Works
1. **Team Selection**: After login, users must select a team to continue
2. **Session Persistence**: Selected team is stored in localStorage for the session
3. **API Integration**: All session-inserting APIs use the selected team as default
4. **Team Context**: Dashboard displays the currently selected team

### Team Selection Flow
1. User logs in successfully
2. Redirected to `/choose-team` page
3. Selects a team from the dropdown
4. Team selection is saved and user is redirected to dashboard
5. Dashboard shows selected team name in the navbar

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/teams` - Fetch all available teams
- `GET /api/team-selection?teamId={id}` - Get team details
- `POST /api/team-selection` - Validate team selection

## Captcha Solving

The platform includes advanced captcha solving capabilities:

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Detection**: Scans login pages for captcha elements
2. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes high-quality screenshots of captcha images
3. **AI Processing**: Uses Gemini Flash 2.0 for text recognition
4. **Auto-fill**: Automatically fills captcha input fields
5. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after processing
